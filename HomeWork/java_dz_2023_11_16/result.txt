Kris: It all started with this
online game about Vikings.
Nicolas and I
ended up
on the same team
and, after each game,
there was this chat session.
Well, Nicolas wrote these really funny
comments about the teams and the
other players,
and he made me laugh.
I’d write replies to his comments,
and he’d come back with another joke
and, you know,
it was a lot of fun.
Then we sort of started messaging
each other when we weren’t gaming.
Like me,
Nicolas is crazy about
anything to do with Vikings –
like, he’s read all the history
and just knows so much.
We’ve never met up
because he lives in Bogotá,
in Colombia,
so it’s not like we’re neighbours
or anything.
And that’s the other amazing
thing about him.
Like, he’s never left Colombia,
but his English is almost perfect.
We’ve spoken online –
I don’t know how his English
got to be so good.
I have so much more in
common with Nicolas
than I do with the friends I see every day.
Alex: Zohra and I met on this fan website
for The Hunger Games.
We both think this is one of the most
amazing series of books we’ve ever read.
But we both really enjoy
other science fiction as well.
A lot of people on the fan site
just wanted to talk about
The Hunger Games
and nothing else,
but Zohra was like me and wanted
to read other writers –
like, some of the classic writers
of science fiction –
Frank Herbert,
Ursula K. Le Guin,
Philip K. Dick –
people like that.
So for a while we would decide together
what book to read,
and after every chapter
we’d discuss what had happened
and guess what might happen next.
I really enjoyed this way of reading.
It kind of made it more interesting.
And then I had this idea
that we could set up a book club online
and, you know, include a few more people.
But Zohra wasn’t too interested in that.
I could sort of feel her pulling away.
She didn’t text so often,
and suddenly she didn’t have time to read
a book together –
that sort of thing.
That’s fine.
I enjoyed having an online friend,
but I didn’t want to have just one friend –
I wanted more.
In fact,
now I’ve got a lot more –
I set up the book club anyway.
Kelly: I joined a discussion board called
‘Greenie’ and I could see immediately that
Joe was the guy with the best ideas.
There were always a lot of
comments about
how bad things are,
and how the environment is
suffering and all that.
But Joe was practical
and would always ask,
‘OK, so what are we going to do about it?’
and then he would suggest something –
small and simple things,
but practical things.
You know, like,
‘Everyone turn off your air conditioning
and open the windows –
sweat it out for the planet!’
‘I like people who do stuff and
don’t just talk about it.
Then I figured out that
Joe and I live in the same town.
So,
we messaged a little
and agreed to meet up.
Together with some online
friends and some face-to-face friends,
we’ve set up a local action group.
We got the city council to set aside
some green areas
and we’re raising money to buy
trees to plant there.
And we’ve set up a website
to show everyone what we’re doing
and we’re attracting
more friends who want to join in.
That’s the thing with online friendships –
sometimes they carry over into the real world,
and you can do some amazing things.
The sun rises in the east.
The bus doesn’t go past my house.
I study for about an hour a week.
We never get much homework.
Do you agree?
I don’t know the answer.
Why are you carrying an umbrella?
It’s not raining.
He’s studying Russian at university.
I’m meeting Andrew tonight.
but I’m really tired.
I’ve been speaking Spanish all day!
Are you learning Russian?
but this book’s absolutely useless!
It teaches you how to say
‘my uncle’s black trousers’
but not how to say ‘hello’!
I’ve just read about this girl,
and she’s only 10,
but she’s fluent in several
different languages.
I can only speak one language –
English.
squirrel!!
Squill...
It’s very hard!
I’ll never get it right!
You need to practise.
Try again.
Listen:
squirrel.

Their house is enormous!
It’s got 12 bedrooms.
Was it hot?
Yes,
it was absolutely boiling!
Why do you look
so miserable?
I’ve never seen you looking so sad.
We had a brilliant holiday.
The hotel,
the weather,
the town –
it was all really good.
The food was
absolutely awful.
I’m not going there again!
I was furious when I
found out he’d read my private diary!
The picture’s tiny –
I can’t see it.
Can you make it a bit bigger?
It’s freezing!
Why didn’t I bring a coat?
Here,
you can borrow my jacket.
Your T-shirt’s filthy!
Put it in the washing machine.
That cake is delicious!
Could I have some more, please?
Rachel: Really? ...
Oh, no ...
the bookshop!? ...
Wha ... Are you sure?
Rachel: thanks for letting me know ...
yes, see you soon, Jo ... Bye.
Becky: Excuse me?
Rachel: Oh, sorry! I thought you were just looking.
Becky: Um, I want something for a friend's wife.
I’m going there for dinner.
Rachel: OK.
What sort of flowers does she like?
Becky: Oh, I don't know. I haven’t met her yet.
Rachel: Right ...
well, in my opinion,
roses are always a good option.
Becky: Um ... Aren’t they a bit ... romantic?
Rachel: Um,
yes, I know what you mean.
Rachel: I guess something like tulips
might be better.
Becky: Yes, they're lovely.
How much are they?
Becky: Erm, how much are the tulips?
Rachel: Oh, they're ...
Rachel: ... sorry.
Becky: It's OK.
I'll try somewhere else. Thank you.
Rachel: Hello? ...
Yes.
Yes, it is.
Mark: Rachel?
You OK?
Rachel: Oh,
I'm sorry, love.
I'm just a bit worried.
Jo phoned today and said that the old
bookshop is going to be turned into
another florist's.
Mark: The bookshop on the corner?
I didn’t know they’d sold it.
Rachel: Me neither.
What am I going to do?
It's hard enough already to make money,
but I think it’s going to be impossible
with another florist’s in the same street.
Mark: Yeah ...
Was Jo sure about this?
Rachel: I don’t know.
She seemed pretty certain.
Mark: Well, if you ask me, it's not worth worrying about until we know for sure.
Rachel: I know
but I can't help it –
it's on my mind.
I was even rude to a customer today.
Mark: Really?
That's not like you. What happened?
Rachel: Well, I wasn't exactly rude,
just not very helpful.
Mark: Hey,
don't worry about it.
Let’s just forget about work.
Personally, I need a relaxing evening!
Rachel: Me too!
Mark: Anyway,
Tom and Becky will be here in a minute.
I think we should check on the food.
Rachel: Yes.
I don't want
anything else to go wrong today.
So, what’s Becky like?
Mark: That’ll be them now!
Rachel: Well,
in my opinion,
roses are always a good option.
Rachel: I guess something like
tulips might be better.
Rachel: I think it’s going to be impossible
with another florist’s in the same street.
Mark: Well, if you ask me,
it's not worth
worrying about until we know for sure.
Rachel: I’m really worried.
Jo phoned today with some bad news.
Rachel: I’m really worried
I won’t make enough money.
Rachel: Oh,
I'm sorry, love.
I'm just a bit worried.
Jo phoned today and said that the old
bookshop is going to be turned into
another florist's.
Mark: The bookshop on the corner?
I didn’t know they’d sold it.
Rachel: Me neither.
But what am I going to do?
It's hard enough already to make money,
but I think it’s going to be impossible

Rachel: Me too.
Mark: Hi! Come in!
Hello.
Come on in.
Rachel, this is Tom and Becky.
Tom: Hi, Rachel. Good to meet you.
Rachel: Hi, Tom.
Becky: Hi, Rachel.
Um,
I think we've met before!
Rachel: I'm so sorry about earlier!
I had something on my mind.
Becky: Don't worry.
Erm,
I was going to bring you some flowers,
but I couldn't get any!
Rachel: Thank you.
Maria: How’s your revision going?
Gilberto: Not so good.
I think I can remember most of
the grammar,
but remembering
vocabulary’s a bit harder,
for me anyway.
Maria: Yes,
there are a lot of words to remember.
Gilberto: What about you?
Maria: For me,
it is probably the opposite –
I find the grammar hard
to get my head around,
but the vocabulary is a lot easier.
I’ve been testing myself at home,
and it’s OK.
Gilberto: How do you manage
to remember all the words, though?
What’s your secret?
Maria: Well, it’s no secret!
I have this kind of system for learning
words that seems to make it easy …
Gilberto: OK,
what?
Maria: Well,
when I get home from class,
I record all the new words I’ve
learned onto my phone.
And then I might do something like
go for a run, and I listen to them when I’m running.
And I make up these sentences with the words and say them to myself.
Gilberto: As you’re running?
Maria: Yes, as I’m running –
I just say the sentences quietly to myself.
Gilberto: Do you remember what
the words mean?
Maria: Most of the time.
If I forget,
I check in my notebook when I get home
from my run.
And sometimes
I play the words and write them down.
I think the most important
thing is to keep repeating them.
I don’t know why,
but remembering the sounds of
the words is important for me.
Like,
last week I learned the word ‘shine’ –
you know, like ‘the sun is shining’.
And that ‘sh’ sound at the beginning
of the word
makes me think of light that’s getting
brighter and brighter.
Gilberto: Interesting.
But I don’t know if it would work for me.
I need to see things written down.
I need to look at the word.
Maria: Right – my sister’s like that, too.
She uses vocabulary cards.
Have you tried that?
Gilberto: No.
How does that work?
Maria: She has these small cards
and writes all the new words on a card
with a picture,
or a definition and an example –
sometimes a translation, too.
It worked really well …
for a while.
Gilberto: For a while?
Why? What happened?
Maria: She left all the cards on the train.
Gilberto: Oh, yes.
That’s probably what I would do!
Maria: I felt so sorry for her –
after all that work.
Gilberto: It sounds like a good idea,
but it sounds like you have to be quite
organised to have a card system.
Maria: Yes, that’s true.
Gilberto: And, to be honest,
I think I’m maybe too lazy to write
all those cards and
keep them with me wherever I go!
